# jt-sbt-plugin

As sbt is recursive (of course) this plugin is very productive for working with multiple Scala projects.

## My take on SBT and Scala

SBT is misnamed.  Nobody thinks it's simple.  It should be named the Scala Build Tool; in my opinion, it's a good example of Scala and its philosophy.
* of course, it's written in Scala
* they made their own DSL (since Scala is the "Scalable Language")
* complicated
* powerful
